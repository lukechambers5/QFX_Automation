# QFX Automation

This internal Python tool streamlines the processing of CSV files containing financial transaction data. Built with a custom Tkinter GUI, it transforms raw exports into clean, structured Excel workbooks ready for reporting and reconciliation.

## What It Does

- Accepts `.csv` files with transactional financial data
- Cleans and standardizes column values:
  - Abbreviates `ACCOUNT_NAME` for easier reading
  - Deletes unwanted columns (e.g., `DFI_ID`, `FITID`)
- Converts `DTPOSTED` to readable `DATE` column
- Generates a unique `ID` for each row based on:
  - `ACCOUNT_NAME` + Excel-style serial date + `TRNAMT`
- Detects and splits:
  - Duplicates ‚Üí saved in a separate sheet
  - Double duplicates ‚Üí isolated to a third sheet
- Exports cleaned results to an `.xlsx` file with multiple tabs
- Preserves date formatting for Excel compatibility
- Provides a modern and intuitive GUI with file selection and open buttons
